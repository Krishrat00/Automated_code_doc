### Introduction

This repository contains a basic Python program that demonstrates a simple "Hello World" print statement.

### Code Overview

The provided Python code consists of a single line:

print("Hello World")

This line uses the built-in `print()` function to display the string "Hello World" on the console.

### Usage

To run the program, simply save it as a Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`) and execute it from the command line using the following command:

python hello_world.py

This will output the following message to the console:

Hello World

## Introduction

This program is a basic example of how to use conditional statements in Python. It checks if the value 1 is equal to 1 and prints different messages based on the result.

## Code Walkthrough

# This program prints a greeting and then checks if 1 is equal to 1. 
# If true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "Oh no".

print("Hi I am chaitali")
if(1==1):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("Oh no")

The code starts by printing a greeting message: "Hi I am chaitali". Then, it uses an `if` statement to check if 1 is equal to 1. Since this condition is always true, the program prints "Yes". The `else` block is not executed in this case.
