## Project Overview

This project serves as a basic example of a Python program. It demonstrates the fundamental concept of printing output to the console.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a single script with a simple `print` statement.

**main.py**

# This program prints "Hello World" to the console.
print("Hello World")

## Usage

To run the program, simply execute the `main.py` file from the terminal:

python main.py

This will print "Hello World" to the console.

## Project Overview

This project showcases fundamental Python elements including:

- **Printing to the console:**  The `print()` function displays text on the terminal.
- **Conditional statements:**  An `if-else` block evaluates a condition and executes code based on its outcome.

## Code Breakdown

The script consists of two main parts:

1. **Greeting:** 
   - `print("Hi I am chaitali")` : This line prints a greeting message to the console.

2. **Conditional check:**
   - `if(1==1):`: This line checks if the condition `1==1` is true. Since `1` is indeed equal to `1`, the condition evaluates to True.
   - `print("Yes")`:  This line prints "Yes" to the console because the condition was True.
   - `else:`: This keyword marks the alternative code to be executed if the condition is False.
   - `print("Oh no")`:  This line would have printed "Oh no" if the condition had been False, but it's not reached in this case.
