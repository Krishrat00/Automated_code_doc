* Conditional statements (`if-else`).

## Code Explanation

The code consists of two main parts:

1. **Greeting:** The first line prints a simple greeting message to the console.
2. **Conditional Check:** The second part uses an `if` statement to check the condition `1==1`. If the condition is true, the script prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "Oh no".

```bash
python script.py
```

This will produce the following output:

```
Hi I am chaitali
