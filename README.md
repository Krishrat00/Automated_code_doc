### Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic printing functionality. 

### Code Overview

The code consists of a single line that uses the `print()` function to display the message "Hello World" to the console. 

**File:** `main.py`

# This is a simple Python program that prints the message "Hello World" to the console.
print("Hello World")

# Simple Python Program

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic conditional logic.

1. **Code Structure**

## Code Structure

The provided Python code consists of a single block that:

1. **Prints a greeting**: The line `print("Hi I am chaitali")` outputs the string "Hi I am chaitali" to the console.
2. **Checks a condition**: The `if(1==1)` statement evaluates the expression `1==1`. Since `1` is indeed equal to `1`, the condition is considered true.
3. **Prints based on the condition**: Based on the truth value of the condition, the program executes either the `print("Yes")` statement (in case of a true condition) or the `print("Oh no")` statement (in case of a false condition). 

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates a basic example of conditional logic in Python. It showcases how to evaluate a condition and execute different code blocks based on the result.
