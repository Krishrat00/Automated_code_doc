### Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates the basic functionality of printing text to the console.

### Usage

To run the program, simply execute the Python file. The output will be displayed in the console:

Hello World

### Code Structure

The code consists of a single line that uses the `print()` function to display the string "Hello World" to the console.

### Description

This Python script demonstrates basic programming concepts like printing to the console and conditional statements.

It first prints a greeting "Hi I am chaitali". 

Then, it uses an `if-else` statement to check if the condition `1==1` is true. As this condition is always true, the script prints "Yes".

### Usage

To run the script:

1. Save the code in a file named `script.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the command `python script.py`.

This will execute the script and print the output:

Hi I am chaitali
Yes
