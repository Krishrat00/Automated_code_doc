## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates the basic functionality of printing a string to the console. 

## Usage

To run the script:

1. Save the code in a file named `script.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Execute the command: `python script.py`

### Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates basic conditional statements. 

### Code Breakdown

The provided code consists of a single script that performs the following actions:

1. **Prints a greeting:** `print("Hi I am chaitali")`
2. **Checks a condition:** `if(1==1):`
   - If the condition is true (1 is indeed equal to 1), it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "Oh no".

This script demonstrates the use of the `if` and `else` statements in Python, which allow for the execution of different code blocks based on the evaluation of a condition.
