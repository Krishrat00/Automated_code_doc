## Overview

The code in this repository showcases a basic `if-else` statement in Python. The program checks a simple condition (`1 == 1`) and prints different messages based on the outcome.

## Code Explanation

# This program demonstrates a simple conditional statement in Python.
print("Hi I am chaitali")
if(1==1):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("Oh no")

- **Line 1:** A comment explaining the purpose of the program.
- **Line 2:** Prints a greeting message to the console.
- **Lines 3-6:** An `if-else` statement:
    - **Line 3:** The condition `1 == 1` is evaluated. Since it's true, the code within the `if` block will execute.
    - **Line 4:** Prints "Yes" to the console.
    - **Lines 5-6:** The `else` block is not executed because the condition was true.

This script demonstrates the fundamental concepts of conditional statements in Python, which allow programs to execute different paths based on specific conditions.
