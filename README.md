### Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates the basic concept of printing a message to the console. 

### Usage

To run the program, simply execute the Python script. This will print the message "Hello World" to the console.

python script.py

This program serves as a starting point for understanding how to interact with the console and display output in Python.

### Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic programming concepts. The program is designed for educational purposes and provides a starting point for understanding fundamental programming constructs.

### Code Overview

The code consists of two main parts:

1. **Printing a Message:** The first line of code prints a greeting message to the console.

print("Hi I am chaitali")

2. **If-Else Statement:** The subsequent lines demonstrate an if-else statement that evaluates a condition and executes different code blocks based on the result.

if(1==1):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("Oh no")

This code snippet checks if the value `1` is equal to itself. Since this is always true, the `print("Yes")` statement is executed, and the `else` block is skipped. 

The code is a basic example, but it showcases essential elements of Python programming, such as:

* **Printing Output:** Using the `print()` function to display text in the console.
* **Conditional Statements:** Utilizing `if` and `else` statements to control program flow based on conditions. 
* **Comparison Operators:**  Employing the equality operator (`==`) to compare values. 

This simple program provides a foundation for further exploration of Python programming, allowing users to build upon these fundamental concepts and create more complex and sophisticated applications.
