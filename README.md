## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic conditional statements.

## Code Walkthrough

The code consists of two main parts:

1. **Greeting:** The program starts by printing a greeting message: "Hi I am chaitali".

2. **Conditional Statement:** The program then evaluates the condition `1==1`. Since this condition is always true, the program prints "Yes". If the condition were false, it would print "Oh no".

This program provides a basic illustration of how to use conditional statements in Python to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.
