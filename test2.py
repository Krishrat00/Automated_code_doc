### About

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic conditional statements and output. The program prints a greeting and then evaluates a simple condition (1==1) to determine which message to print next. 

### Usage

The program can be run directly from the terminal using the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the code and produce the following output:

```
Hi I am chaitali
Yes
```

### Code Structure

The program consists of a single Python file (`main.py`) which contains the following code:

```python
# This program prints a greeting message and then checks a simple condition
# to print another message based on the result.
print("Hi I am chaitali")
if(1==1):
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("Oh no")

```
